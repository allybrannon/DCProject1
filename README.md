Group project using API's: Contributors: Joshua, Ally, Patrick

Quotables uses three APIs(QuoteGarden, NumbersAPI, and Wikimedia) to create a website that quizzes the user on quotes, presenting them with four options, only one of which is correct.

To play, simply click the answer you think is correct. If you are correct, it'll increase your streak at the bottom left hand corner. If you are wrong, the screen will populate with the correct answer, and recommendations to expand your knowledge on that particular author or sources related.
